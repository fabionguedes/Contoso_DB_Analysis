# Contoso Data Base Analysis
Let's do a case study with the ContosoRetailDW database.

### 1. What are we going to analyze?
Product returns.

### 2. Why are we going to analyze?
Returns may be directly impacting the company's profitability. Profit = Revenue - Cost 
Increasing 1 dollar of revenue does not necessarily increase 1 dollar of profit.
Reducing 1 dollar in cost is increasing 1 dollar in profit.

### 3. Where will we analyze?
Contoso Database (FactSales Table).

### 4. How will we analyze?
Using the SQL language.

## > What were the conclusions?
- Northwind Traders: Product brand with the highest return rate, but the least representative. What happened to this brand?
- Returns by store and sales channel are nothing too serious, but it's worth keeping an eye on the store with the highest % of returns (Contoso Toulouse Store = 1.22% vs. Contoso Guangzhou Store = 0.57% - lower rate)
- Delivery time
- Defects
- Customer Service (After sales)
- Reviews on websites

## > Solution suggestions?
- Offering in-store purchase credit
- Exchange for other products (with discount)
- Post return channel to diagnose the real reasons with the customer
- Allocate efforts to media support
- Make a more in-depth comparison between stores with higher returns and stores with lower returns
